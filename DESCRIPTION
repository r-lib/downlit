    c(person(given = "Hadley",
             family = "Wickham",
             role = c("aut", "cre"),

      person(given = "RStudio",

Description: Syntax highlighting of R code, specifically
    designed for the needs of 'RMarkdown' packages like 'pkgdown',
    'hugodown', and 'bookdown'. It includes linking of function calls to
    their documentation on the web, and automatic translation of ANSI
    escapes in output to the equivalent HTML.
