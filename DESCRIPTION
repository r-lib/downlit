Description: Syntax highlighting of R code, specifically designed
    for the needs of 'RMarkdown' packages like 'pkgdown', 'hugodown', and
    'bookdown'. It includes linking of function calls to their documentation
    on the web, and automatic translation of ANSI escapes in output to the
    equivalent HTML.
